# Part III

## Audience analysis
I used to set my audience to be everyone, but that seems too wide
thus I changed my target audience to be young females and people who care about them. 




## Changes made since Part II
 
1.Charts:
Change the color 

– apply gray to all other fields except ‘very safe’, thus to stress the fact that the female feel less safe to call a car online. Thus chart changed from left to right

2.Contents:
More narratives 

-contents on shorthand used to be just points, and very simple, since shorthand is more than just slices showing points, to tell a story better, narratives can be abundant.

Narrow down the topics from all females in the USA to be young girls.

-The topic used to be [Do females feel safe in the USA?] and it has been changed to be [Do young females feel safe in the USA?], as there is one chart showing that age between 10 to 30 takes 50% of the case, thus narrow down the topic from all female to young female makes more sense.


3.Data and references:
Source in the end can be somehow unclear as it is hard to link to the corresponding content, thus I added [data from] in every chart and materials to make the source more clear.
