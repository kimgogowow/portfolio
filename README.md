### Difference analysis:

Compared to the first one, the second one obviously has more clear vision over a period of time, instead of only one specific year. Hence audiences can see the trend better. Line graph helps to see each countryâ€™s situation with separate grids. And the dot in the end of each line stressed the ending point of each one, which can be a good mark to show the latest situation of each country.

But the second version also has problems. Firstly, each graph is individual from all others, thus we can not tell the overall situation, like which one is the highest or which one is the lowest. While each grid is very small, thus even with an ending dot to stress the current data, it is still very hard to tell the difference.

Thus I  choose to use histogram instead of line chart. Firstly, the area of histogram can represent the scale of each countryâ€™s debt better. For example, it is very clear that AUT has more debt than AUS as its blue area is bigger. On the other hand, I changed the color from brown to dark blue , which seems more like a finance color, seems more reliable and professional.
