Overall to say, every one is surprised by the effect of shorthand draft program, and the story telling logic works well, they can clear get my call for action part. Problems lies at what pics to choose to fit the topic better and whether should I create another heading. Also, too much narratives can cause reading tiredness as well, for each chart, I should only use one sentence to point out the main finding in the chart.
