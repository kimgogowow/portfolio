### 6.summary

#### Modification and reasons:
1.color has been changed to avoid red and its similar colors to cause any visual confusion.

2.only one time period data is strong enough to support my opinion, thus I just kept the lastest one.

3.use bar chart again as the area of each bar can express the difference more clear.

4.numbers along the y-axis are all removed as it is not necessary, and removing then can help to make the chart simplier.

5.arrows pointing to trend change are removed as well, as it can be confusing that this normally applies to the same thing, for example the income changes along with time, so it is inappropriate to apply to three different income level.

6.make the average income ( all household) situation to be a parallel line to x-axis so it can be a better benchmark as it cross all other three bars areas.

7.dollors icon are applied along x-axis as one audience mentioned that, audience can assume that x-axis refers to the change of time. Thus images here can help to stress that x-axis actually represents different income level.

8.completed the title with country name in the end to make it clear.

#### Improvements on standards:

After the modification, the perceptibility has improved, both audiences agree that they can get the core information from the modified one easier and faster than the original version, which requires them to do many comparisons and logic understandings in the first sight. However, with the application of faces, they can get that the low income level level has the worst situation immediately.

Aesthetics also improved as the icon removed, which makes the chart not that crowded, and color changed, and cartoon faces used. One audience even mentioned that she likes the hand made chart better than a formal one made by computer tools due to personal aesthetic style.
